<p class="drop">In the Year of Our Lord 1444, <strong>Rolandas Drungilas</strong>, fifteen years of age, was crowned in Varniai. 
He was brilliant, unmarried, and without heir; his claim was steadied by omen and by the acclaim of elders.</p>

  <div class="callout-body">“The crown weighed heavy, though wrought of gold; it bore the burden of youth, of forests, and of foes on every border.”</div>
</div>

<h2>First Musters</h2>
<p>The ducal host was small but keen: the <strong>Iron Wolf</strong> regiment — <em>5,000 infantry</em> and <em>1,000 cavalry</em> — led by <strong>Zygimantas Sudimantaitis</strong>.</p>

<h2>Faith & Rite</h2>
<p>Though crowned beneath the Cross, the Bear‑King forbade no village their fires to Perkūnas. Thus began the long balance: <em>altar and oak‑grove</em>.</p>
