## Accession & Legitimacy
<p class="dropcap">In the Year of Our Lord 1444, Rolandas Drungilas, but fifteen years of age, was crowned in Varniai Cathedral. Though young in years, he was made strong in spirit by the omen of the White Bear and the acclaim of the council of elders. The bishop anointed him *Dux Samogitiae* — yet among the people he was already called the **Bear-King**.</p>

!!! note "Regnal Style"
    **Dux Samogitiae** — Duke of Samogitia.  
    Among the folk: **Meškų Karalius** — the Bear-King.

Yet his claim was fragile: he was unmarried, and without heir. The line of Drungilas was but newly planted, and its roots shallow.

## The Council of Elders
Rolandas’ youth demanded the guidance of the **Council of Elders**. Each noble house sought to bind him to their interests. Some whispered he was but a figurehead; others feared he would grasp too much power too swiftly.

| House | Lord | Strength | Stance |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Gediminai | Gediminas Gediminai | 1,000 cavalry | Loyal to the Duke; Master of Horse |
| Kuršaitis | Jurgis Kuršaitis | 2,000 spearmen | Guarded; seeks privilege |
| Radvila (minor branch) | Motiejus Radvila | 800 levy | Ambitious; favors ties to Lithuania |

## Diplomacy of a Youthful Duke
Samogitia’s throne sat in peril between three powers:

- **Lithuania**: Overlord in years past, jealous of Samogitia’s independence, yet distracted by its Polish union.  
- **Teutonic Order**: Defeated at Grunwald but still proud, eager to reclaim Samogitia’s fields.  
- **Livonian Order**: Stern crusaders to the north, stone fortresses glaring across the Daugava.

Rolandas’ policy was one of balance: to **play each neighbor against the other**, offering peace to one hand while readying the sword with the other.

!!! quote "Words of the Duke"
    *“The forest bends to no wind; it bows only to storm. So too shall Samogitia bend to none, save when it must break the stronger.”*

## Military & Reforms
The ducal host, small but loyal, stood thus at his coronation:

| Year | Infantry | Cavalry | Total | Commander |
|-----:|---------:|--------:|------:|-----------|
| 1444 | 5,000    | 1,000   | 6,000 | Gediminas Gediminai |

!!! tip "Army Doctrine"
    - **Infantry**: Spear and shield levies; hardened by raids and marches.  
    - **Cavalry**: Swift light horse; descendents of pagan riders.  
    - **Doctrine**: Strike swiftly from forest, harry the foe, vanish before his might.

The Duke decreed that every noble must provide men at arms, codifying levy obligations into the **Law of Varniai** — the first written military charter of Samogitia.

## Faith & the Altar of Perkūnas
Though Rolandas was crowned beneath the Cross, he did not forbid the old fires. In the villages, offerings to **Perkūnas** and **Žemyna** continued. Priests grumbled, but the Duke answered:

!!! quote "Rolandas to the Bishop"
    *“Can the plowman forget the rain? So too can the Samogitian not forget the fire. The Cross shall guard the soul; the Oak shall guard the hearth.”*

Thus began a reign of **dual faith**: a delicate balance between Rome and the groves.

## The First Years
Chronicles note that Rolandas’ first acts were not of conquest, but of **consolidation**:

- Summoned **Gediminas Gediminai** as Marshal of the Realm.  
- Bound noble houses by oath of fealty in Varniai.  
- Ordered watchtowers along the **Venta River** against Teutonic raids.  
- Commissioned a **new chronicle** to record his reign (the very work we read).

## Closing Summary
Thus dawned the reign of **Rolandas Drungilas**, the Bear-King. Young of age, unwed, without heir — yet girded by omen, by council, and by sword. Whether lion or bear would triumph in his rule was yet unwritten, but in the hearts of his people there stirred both fear and hope.
