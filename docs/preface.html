<h1>Preface</h1>
<p class="drop">This codex is written for the Chronicler alone; a private book of remembrance and resolve.
It records the realm of <strong>Samogitia (Å½emaitija)</strong>, beginning on the eleventh day of November, in the year 1444. 
Within are the annals of rulers and wars, the customs of the people, and the signs granted by heaven and grove alike.</p>
