# Geography of the Realm (1444)

Samogitia lies upon the **Baltic frontier**, a land of forest, marsh, and field. Its destiny is shaped by its neighbors as much as by its rivers.

## Capital — Varniai
A modest seat nestled among lakes and groves; there the bishop’s crozier and the elders’ staves meet.

## Rivers & Land
- **Venta** and **Dubysa** bind the heartlands to Baltic trade.
- Thick **forests** shield the realm; **marshes** clog the roads of invaders.
- **Fertile soil** sustains barley and rye — the backbone of the rural economy.

## Neighbors
- **Teutonic Order (west)** — weakened yet watchful.
- **Livonian Order (north)** — stone fortresses glaring across the Daugava.
- **Lithuania (south & east)** — erstwhile overlord, distracted by Polish union yet jealous of Samogitia’s autonomy.
