## The Dawn of the Duchy
<p class="dropcap">The land of Samogitia, called Žemaitija in the tongue of its people, had long stood as a <strong>bastion of defiance</strong>. Crusaders of the Teutonic and Livonian Orders had waged centuries of holy war against its forests and fields, yet the people endured. Neither sword nor sermon could uproot their spirit.</p>

By the mid-fifteenth century, as Lithuania turned eastward under Polish union and the Orders waned in might, the people of Žemaitija sought their own destiny. From this crucible of faith and forest rose **Duke Rolandas Drungilas**, a youth of fifteen summers, chosen not by blood-right but by the acclaim of elders and an omen from the old gods.

## The Prophecy of the Bear

> *“The old gods yield their charge, and the young lion shall rule the forest.”*

Legend tells that Rolandas, when yet a boy, wandered deep into the grove of **Medvėgalis Hill**, where the sacred oak still bore scars of pagan fire. There he encountered a **white bear**, larger than any hunter had seen. Instead of rending him, the beast knelt. From that hour the folk named him the **Bear‑King**.

The lion was set upon the Lithuanian tricolor as the emblem of the new house; yet in the songs of herdsmen and soldiers, it was ever the **bear** who walked beside the duke.

Thus was born the motto: **_Ex Silva, Virtus_ — From the Forest, Strength.**

## Coronation in Varniai
Rolandas was crowned in **Varniai Cathedral**, seat of the bishopric, yet the rites bore traces of older faith: oak leaves upon the altar, drums echoing with bells. Chroniclers relate that when the crown touched his brow, thunder rolled across the valley though no storm was seen.

The bishop proclaimed him *Dux Samogitiae* — Duke of Samogitia. The villages, less mindful of Rome, called him simply **Meškų Karalius** — the Bear‑King.

## The Council of Elders
Rolandas, though styled duke, stood **first among equals**. The great houses of Samogitia gathered in council to affirm his rule and bind him to their ancient rights. Thus was the realm balanced: **ducal will** against **noble liberty**, **altar** against **oak‑fire**, **youth** supported by **seasoned swords**.

## The First Army
Upon his coronation, Rolandas could call upon **6,000 men**:
- **5,000 Infantry** — yeomen and townsmen, spear and shield in hand.
- **1,000 Cavalry** — light horse of the forest edge, swift and relentless.

This host was entrusted to **Gediminas Gediminai**, called “the Duke’s Sword,” a veteran whose loyalty steadied the realm.

## Faith at the Edge of Christendom
Though Catholic by law, Samogitia remained the **last fortress of Baltic paganism**. In Varniai, Latin hymns rose each Sunday; in the countryside, fires still burned to Perkūnas, thunder‑god. The Church tolerated these customs for the peace of the realm.

## The Threshold of Destiny
Thus stood Samogitia in the year 1444: a young duke without heir, a wary council, covetous neighbors, and an army untested. Yet hope burned in the people’s songs:

> *“Where lion and bear walk together, no knight nor prince shall conquer.”*
