# The Origins of Samogitia

## The Dawn of the Duchy
<p class="dropcap">The land of Samogitia, called Žemaitija in the tongue of its people, had long stood as a <strong>bastion of defiance</strong>. Crusaders of the Teutonic and Livonian Orders had waged centuries of holy war against its forests and fields, yet the people endured. Neither sword nor sermon could uproot their spirit.</p>

By the mid-15th century, as Lithuania turned eastward under Polish union and the Orders weakened after their defeats, the people of Žemaitija sought their own destiny. From this crucible of faith and forest rose **Duke Rolandas Drungilas**, a youth of only fifteen summers, chosen not by divine right but by the acclaim of elders and omen of the gods.

## The Prophecy of the Bear

!!! quote "The Bear’s Submission"
    *“The old gods yield their charge, and the young lion shall rule the forest.”*

Legend tells that Rolandas, when still a boy, wandered deep into the grove of **Medvėgalis Hill**, where the sacred oak still bore scars of pagan fire. There he encountered a **white bear**, larger than any hunter had seen. Instead of rending him, the beast knelt.

The elders declared that the pagan spirits had yielded their guardianship to the youth. The lion became the emblem of the new house, standing proudly on the Lithuanian tricolor. Yet in the folk songs, the **bear** remained — a secret guardian of Samogitia, walking unseen beside its dukes.

Thus was born the motto: **_Ex Silva, Virtus_ — From the Forest, Strength.**

## Coronation in Varniai
Rolandas was crowned in **Varniai Cathedral**, seat of the Catholic bishopric, yet the rites bore traces of older faith: oak leaves upon the altar, pagan drums echoing with church bells. Chroniclers note that when the crown touched his brow, thunder rolled across the valley though no storm was seen.

The bishop proclaimed him *Dux Samogitiae* — Duke of Samogitia. Yet in the villages, he was called *Mešku Karalius*, “The Bear‑King,” for the omen that had set him apart.

## The Council of Elders
Rolandas, though styled duke, was **first among equals**. The great houses of Samogitia, bound by oath and kin, gathered in council to affirm his rule. These elders — part chieftains, part noble lords — demanded that their new duke safeguard their ancient rights.

Thus was Samogitia’s political life forged in balance: between **ducal ambition** and **noble freedom**, between **Catholic bishopric** and **pagan traditions**, between **youthful ruler** and **seasoned commander**.

## The First Army
Upon his coronation, Rolandas could call upon **6,000 men**:
- **5,000 Infantry** — yeomen and townsmen, spear and shield in hand, accustomed to defending their soil.
- **1,000 Cavalry** — light horse, swift raiders of the forest edge, whose lineage traced back to the pagan riders that had once harried crusader convoys.

This host was led by **Gediminas Gediminai**, “the Duke’s Sword,” a steady hand beside the youthful ruler.

## Symbols of Rule
- **The Lion**: standing upon the Lithuanian tricolor, symbol of courage and authority.
- **The Bear**: spirit guardian of the land, tied to Rolandas’ vision.
- **The Colors**: Yellow for grain, Green for the forest, Red for the blood shed in defense.
- **The Motto**: *Ex Silva, Virtus* — carved above Varniai’s gatehouse and carried on the lips of soldiers.

## Faith at the Edge of Christendom
Though Catholic by law, Samogitia remained the **last fortress of Baltic paganism**. In Varniai, Latin hymns filled the cathedral; in the countryside, fires still burned to Perkūnas, thunder‑god. The Church tolerated these customs for the sake of peace, yet priests muttered that syncretism was but heresy in disguise.

## The Threshold of Destiny
Thus stood Samogitia in the year of our Lord 1444: a young duke without heir, a council wary of his youth, neighbors who coveted his fields, and an army untested. Yet hope burned in the people’s songs:

> *“Where lion and bear walk together, no knight nor prince shall conquer.”*
