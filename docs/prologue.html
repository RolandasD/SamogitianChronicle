<h1>Prologue</h1>

<h2>The Founding Legend</h2>
<p class="drop">In the twilight of the old faith, when the forests of Žemaitija whispered with pagan voices, a child was born in Varniai: <strong>Rolandas Drungilas</strong>. 
At fifteen he was raised by the acclaim of elders and the sign of a <em>white bear</em> that bowed before him in the grove of Medvėgalis.
From that day the folk named him the <em>Bear‑King</em>.</p>

<blockquote>“The old gods yield their charge, and the young lion shall rule the forest.”</blockquote>
