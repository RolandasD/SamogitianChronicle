Crusaders of the Teutonic and Livonian Orders had waged centuries of holy war against its forests and fields, yet the people endured. Neither sword nor sermon could uproot their spirit.</p> <p>By the mid-15th century, as Lithuania turned eastward under Polish union and the Teutonic knights weakened after their defeats, the people of \u017demaitija sought their own destiny. From this crucible of faith and forest rose Duke Rolandas Drungilas, a youth of only fifteen summers, chosen not by divine right but by the acclaim of elders and omen of the gods.</p> <p>The Prophecy of the Bear</p> <p>Legends tell that Rolandas, when still a boy, wandered deep into the grove of Medv\u0117galis Hill, where the sacred oak still bore scars of pagan fire. There he encountered a white bear, larger than any hunter had seen. Instead of rending him, the beast knelt.</p> <p>The elders declared: \u201cThe old gods yield their charge, and the young lion shall rule the forest.\u201d The lion became the emblem of the new house, standing proudly on the Lithuanian tricolor. Yet in folk songs, the bear remained \u2014 a secret guardian of Samogitia, walking unseen beside its dukes.</p> <p>Thus was born the motto: \u201cEx Silva, Virtus\u201d \u2014 From the Forest, Strength. For both lion and bear sprang from the wild, and so too would Samogitia\u2019s might.</p> <p>Coronation in Varniai</p> <p>Rolandas was crowned in Varniai Cathedral, seat of the Catholic bishopric, yet the rites bore traces of older faith: oak leaves upon the altar, pagan drums echoing with church bells. Chroniclers note that when the crown touched his brow, thunder rolled across the valley though no storm was seen.</p> <p>The bishop proclaimed him Dux Samogitiae \u2014 Duke of Samogitia. Yet in the villages, he was called Me\u0161ku Karalius, \u201cThe Bear-King,\u201d for the omen that had set him apart.</p> <p>The Land and Its People</p> <p>Samogitia was a land both blessed and cursed by geography.</p> <p>To the west, the Teutonic Order, nursing grudges from Grunwald.</p> <p>To the north, the Livonian Order, their stone fortresses glaring across the Daugava.</p> <p>To the south, Lithuania, distracted by union but jealous of losing its westernmost jewel.</p> <p>Between these foes lay forests so thick a man might walk a day without sight of sun. Marshes guarded the frontiers, while fertile fields provided barley and rye for the people. The rivers Venta and Dubysa tied Varniai to the wider Baltic, a lifeline for trade and diplomacy.</p> <p>The people themselves were hardy: farmers who bore axes as often as plows, hunters who saw no divide between war and daily toil. Pagan customs lingered \u2014 midsummer bonfires, sacred groves, whispered oaths \u2014 even as crosses rose above churches.</p> <p>The Council of Elders</p> <p>Rolandas, though styled duke, was first among equals. The great houses of Samogitia, bound by oath and kin, gathered in council to affirm his rule. These elders \u2014 part chieftains, part noble lords \u2014 demanded that their new duke safeguard their ancient rights.</p> <p>Thus was Samogitia\u2019s political life forged in balance: between ducal ambition and noble freedom, between Catholic bishopric and pagan traditions, between youthful ruler and seasoned commander.</p> <p>The First Army</p> <p>Upon his coronation, Rolandas could call upon 6,000 men:</p> <p>5,000 Infantry: yeomen and townsmen, spear and shield in hand, accustomed to defending their soil.</p> <p>1,000 Cavalry: light horse, swift raiders of the forest edge, whose lineage traced back to the pagan riders that had once harried crusader convoys.</p> <p>This host was led by Gediminas Gediminai, a soldier of Lithuanian descent who had turned his loyalty northward. Chroniclers call him \u201cthe Duke\u2019s Sword,\u201d a steady hand beside the youthful ruler.</p> <p>Symbols of Rule</p> <p>The Lion: standing upon the Lithuanian tricolor, symbol of courage and authority.</p> <p>The Bear: spirit guardian of the land, tied to Rolandas\u2019 vision.</p> <p>The Colors: Yellow for fields of grain, Green for the forest, Red for the blood shed in defense.</p> <p>The Motto: Ex Silva, Virtus \u2014 carved above Varniai\u2019s gatehouse and carried on the lips of soldiers.</p> <p>Faith at the Edge of Christendom</p> <p>Though Catholic by law, Samogitia remained the last fortress of Baltic paganism. In Varniai, Latin hymns filled the cathedral; in the countryside, fires still burned to Perk\u016bnas, thunder-god. The Church tolerated these customs for the sake of peace, yet priests muttered that syncretism was but heresy in disguise.</p> <p>This dual faith made Samogitia unique: neither fully of Rome, nor of the old oak. Chroniclers would later write that it was \u201ca land with one foot in the altar, and the other in the forest fire.\u201d</p> <p>The Threshold of Destiny</p> <p>Thus stood Samogitia in the year of our Lord 1444: a young duke without heir, a council wary of his youth, neighbors who coveted his fields, and an army untested. Yet hope burned in the people\u2019s songs:</p> <p>\u201cWhere lion and bear walk together, No knight nor prince shall conquer.\u201d</p> <p>And so begins the Chronicle of Samogitia.</p>"}]}
