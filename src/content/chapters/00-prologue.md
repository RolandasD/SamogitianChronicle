> From the fractured body of Lithuania there rose a lone spark: the Duchy of Samogitia, bound to its single land, Zemaitija. Though small in coin and soil, it chose its own destiny and stepped, by God’s grace, into the perilous assembly of nations. Its very existence was an act of defiance: a boy’s realm surrounded by giants, a candle against the wind that might yet burn bright enough to sear the heavens.

At its helm stood **Duke Rolandas Drungilas**, scarcely fifteen years of age. A child in the eyes of kings, yet one chosen by fate. His court was modest but loyal, and his people whispered prayers that the Virgin guard him. The chronicles would remember these days not for their grandeur but for their fragile courage: a youth’s hand upon the scepter, steady though untried.

### ✦ The Faith and the People ✦

Samogitia bowed outwardly to the Catholic Church, the Cross carried proudly into courts and chapels. Yet in the deep forests and hidden valleys the old gods still whispered — oak and fire, serpent and stone. Though tamed, the old faith was not dead, and its spirit lent the Samogitians a fierce and stubborn character. The people were of Lithuanian blood, steadfast and proud, bound to their language and land. They were not many, but they were enduring.

### ✦ The State of the Realm ✦

The duchy stood independent, neither bound to Lithuania nor chained to Poland. It bore no allies, no enemies at the dawn, though eyes of suspicion lingered from the Teutonic Order to the west and the Livonian Order to the north. Like a lone wolf among packs, Samogitia was free — but freedom could quickly turn to peril.

**Army.** A single host of 6,000 under General Zygimantas Sudimantaitis — 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.  
**Navy.** None; the rivers yet unclaimed by fleet or sail.  
**Economy.** Coffers thin, walls modest; yet construction began at once — fortresses, trade halls, the first seeds of prosperity.

### ✦ The Arms and the Banner ✦[^1]

Above the walls of Zemaitija flew the banner of Samogitia: the Lithuanian tricolor of red, green, and yellow, upon which stood a proud lion argent, upright and defiant. This lion was no beast of submission, but a guardian — the symbol of a people who would not be consumed by their greater neighbors. Chroniclers came to call it the emblem of **Strength in Defiance**.

### ✦ The Inheritance of Samogitia ✦[^2]

Though small in land, Samogitia carried ancestral gifts:

- Builders who raise halls and walls with uncommon speed.  
- Merchants who weave gold from unlikely trade.  
- Priests whose zeal turns hearts toward the Cross.  
- Shipwrights destined to master seas when fleets are born.  
- Armies of iron will; banners that do not falter.

### ✦ The Spirit of Expansion ✦

Samogitia, though poor, was not bound to her land alone. Chroniclers saw omens of greatness: colonists for far seas; missionary schools to spread the true faith; shipwrights for enduring fleets; fortifications strong as stone; and above all, a host not of numbers but of unyielding spirit.
